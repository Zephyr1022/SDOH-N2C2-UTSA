Social History:
The patient lives in [**Location 86**] with his partner of over 30 years.
He has local family but has limited contact with them.  He
reports that he and his partner do not work because they have
enough money to allow them not to need to work.
Mr. [**Known lastname 6418**] reports drinking only one glass of wine a day,
yet also endorses drinking enough prior to admission that he got
confused when taking his medications. Thus, history somewhat
questionable. Denies illicit drug use. He reports having been
sober for a stretch of 14-15 years in the past (w/ help of
rehab, AA), but started drinking again about 13 years ago in the
context of a few deaths in the family.  Per his partner, his
drinking has been much more heavy in recent months.
