SOCIAL HISTORY: 
Per Overlake Medical Center notes has used all of his medicare SNF days for the year and cannot be discharged to SNF, will need to verify. 
His social situation is quite complicated. He has a house that was apparently passed down to him, but it sounds like there is significant clutter (his fall took place as he was returning to the house). He reports that he has not spent very much time at home over the past year and has mostly been in the hospital and in various SNFs. 

When asked about contacts he listed several people, including a cousin ([NAME]) and a pastor. He reports that [NAME] is at a cabin and without the ability to contact him, and was not able to provide the pastor's phone number. We will continue to try to get a phone number for a contact. He also mentioned his Porsche 911 mechanic.
