FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

This pregnancy is remarkable for spontaneous
dichorionic/diamniotic twin gestation.  Pregnancy was
initially uncomplicated with appropriate fetal growth at 6, 8,
and 14 weeks and normal fetal survey in both twins at 18
weeks.  At 24 weeks, growth restriction to the 8th percentile
in twin B was noted, progressing to less than third
percentile over the subsequent weeks.  Two days prior to
delivery, the estimated fetal weight was 768g in this twin, with
reversed end diastolic flow in this twin.  The mother
underwent [**Name (NI) 32007**] for growth restriction under spinal
anesthesia.  There was no labor, no intrapartum fever,
and no other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
Artificial rupture of membranes occurred at delivery and
yielded clear amniotic fluid.  At delivery, the baby emerged
with good tone and cry but was noted to have moderate
intercostal retractions and central cyanosis, which resolved
with facial CPAP.  Apgars were 8 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes.
The baby was transferred to the NICU uneventfully on oxygen
and she was placed on CPAP.

At admission to the NICU, the measurements of the baby were
