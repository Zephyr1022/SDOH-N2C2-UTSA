Numerous and extensive family meetings were held with the staff
and the patient's family.  The family understands that the
patient has profound neurologic injury with extremely poor
prognosis for neurologic recovery.  Nonetheless, the family
continued to desire full treatment.
On [**9-9**] the ethic committee was consulted to offer advice on the
patient's dispo and the family's wishes for care.  The family's
wishes were honored and extensive efforts were made to arrange
for the patient to be placed in a rehabilitation facility.  All
of the family's questions and concerns were addressed.
