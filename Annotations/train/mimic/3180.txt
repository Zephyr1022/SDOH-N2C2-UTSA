Social History: 
Adopted and raised in [LOCATION] by his maternal uncle and uncle's wife.  Finished 2 years of high school, then dropped out.  Worked for 9 months at a fast food restuarant.  About 2 years ago, he moved out and lived with some friends who were a negative influence, did not elaborate.  His notes from Dr. [NAME] and other providers at UW MC say he had poor compliance with his medications, treatements, and f/u visits, presumably referring to this time in his life.  Last year, he moved into a new apartment and reestablished contact with his adopted mother (uncle's wife) and has been making most of his clinic appointments since about [DATE], although he has been hospitalized frequently with exacerbations.  Is now working towards his GED.  Denies any tobacco, EtOH use, or recreational drug use, although he admits to using mushrooms once during that year when he ran away.  His adopted mother works occasionally but mostly stays at home, his adopted father is a officer.  His birth mother is not involved in his life.  He has two younger brothers (their birth mother is his adopted mother).  (from Pulmonary Transplant Note [DATE]).
