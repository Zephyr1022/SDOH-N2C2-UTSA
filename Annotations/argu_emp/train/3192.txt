SOCIAL HISTORY: 
History of 25-pack years. But smoked 3 cigarettes this week due to increased stress. Heavy wine consumption until 8 years ago, now sober. Denies ever having used IV drugs.

Currently living at Interbay Place. Gets around by walking with her belonings in a cart, which she hangs on to for support. Must use bottom bunk because cannot ascend to top bunk. Often finds herself sitting in chair at Rainier House office for days at a time, waiting for a bed, and fearful of going pee and losing her spot in line.

Her family died "all at once" many years ago, and this still causes her great grief. She feels she has little to live for anymore, but is excited at the prospect of promising housing arrangements that might come through soon.
