[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 51857**] Project in a 2 bedroom appt.  The appartment is
in her grandmother's name and no one else is on the lease.  On a
more emotional level her daughter (HCP) would like her mother to
meet her unborn baby.  Apparently when she was well, her mother
stated that she wants to live at all cost and her daughter
believes that she is not in her right mind because she is so
tired because of her illness.
