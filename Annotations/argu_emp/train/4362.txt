A wonderful excerpt from social history taken by Dr. [NAME]:

Born in [LOCATION], but moved all around [LOCATION] with her parents and 4 siblings. [NAME] states the family did not have much money, so all her ailments were treated with whiskey - 'I've been drinking since I was a baby, whiskey fixes everything, you know?' Her father was sexually abusive, and [NAME] ran away at 9 years old after finding out she was pregnant. She was told the baby (son name [NAME]) died in childbirth, only later to find out that he was raised by her uncle in [LOCATION]. She met [NAME] when he was 16 years old, only months before he passed away in a car accident. [NAME] spent most of her life living on the streets, working odd jobs (housekeeping, longshoreman, construction). She went on to marry 5 times, and had two more sons, [NAME] (46yo, lives in [LOCATION]) and [NAME] (42 yo, in [LOCATION]). She is in minimal contact with them, but it is important for her to leave a legacy for them. Enjoys cleaning her apartment, cooking, movies and thrifting.
