SOCIAL HISTORY: Remarkable for the mother being followed in a
methadone clinic in [**Doctor Last Name **].  Her maternal fetal
medicine physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], noted that she was
noncompliant, not showing up for several of her appointments
and reporting three hours late for one appointment.  She
appeared quite sedated to him on a very high dose of
methadone and he requested the services in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]that
this dose be increased.  Also, during the pregnancy, a urine
tox screen was positive for benzodiazepines and she had not
been prescribed this medication.
